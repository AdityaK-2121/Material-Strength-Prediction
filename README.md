# Material-Strength-Prediction
Material strength prediction using ML
This project predicts the Ultimate Tensile Strength (Su) of material using Linear Regression Machine Learning Model.
The dataset contains mechanical properties such as yield strength, elongation, hardness, modulus of elasticity, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, density, and heat treatment type.
The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle.
